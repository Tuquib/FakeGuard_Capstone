FakeGuard is a machine learning-based web application designed to detect fake news. It uses the BERT model to analyze the content of news articles and the Google Fact Check Tools API to verify claims against trusted sources. Users can input a URL or text, and the system provides a real/fake prediction with a confidence score and highlights questionable parts of the article. FakeGuard aims to help users quickly and accurately identify misinformation online.
